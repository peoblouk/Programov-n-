I see no problem with this, provided you add a blurb along the lines of

   "Based on 'An Introduction to Tkinter' Copyright (c) 1997-2005 by Fredrik
    Lundh.  Used with kind permission."

to the document (where 'An Introduction to Tkinter' can, if suitable, be a link
back to the effbot.org source page).
